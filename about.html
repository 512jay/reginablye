    <p class="px-3">I'm Regina Blye and I'm delighted you are interested in my work. This page gives you an opportunity to learn more about my professional experience. To be short, I'm a Disability Rights Advocate, Inclusive Photographer, Music Enthusiast, and &quotwanna be&quot Comedian. </p>
    <p>Long story, I spent the last 10 years of my life serving as the Executive Director of the Texas State Independent Living Council (SILC). I managed a Governor appointed statewide board of directors and staff that focused on upholding the Independent Living philosophy and assisting all folks with disabilities. After a decade of statewide advocacy, I decided to shake things up by focusing on national policy and advocacy. I packed my bags and moved to Washington DC in the middle of winter and planted myself right in the heart of the chaos, I mean excitement!</p>
    <img src="./images/Regina+Blye+-+Looking+at+the+Access+Board+Logo.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded float-left px-3" alt="Regina Blye looking at Access Board Logo on a wall">
    <p class="px-3">I am currently a Project Officer for the US Department of Health and Human Services/Administration for Community Living/Independent Living Administration. I write Congressional letters, disability policy and manage contracts focused on Independent Living. I am also deeply involved in Diversity and Inclusion resource groups for federal employees.</p>
    <p class="px-3">President Obama appointed me to serve two-terms at the United States Access Board. I served as the Vice-Chair, Ad-hoc Chair for several committees during my tenure. I also worked alongside other public and federal members to promote equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards.</p>
    <p class="px-3">I am also the founder and CEO of Slanted Photography, a branding and marketing company that focuses on capturing and promoting diversity and accessibility at public and private events.</p>
    <img src="./images/Regina+Blye+-+Camera+Shot (1).jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded float-right" alt="Regina with camera taking a picure">
    <p class="px-3">In my spare time, I serve on numerous local, statewide, and national boards and organizations. I am frequently traveling across the country for work, speaking engagements, and for cultural diversity. I am a certified Zumba instructor and I am training to be a competitive Boccia player.</p>
    <p class="px-3">I have a few notable accomplishments, such as a commissioned Honorary Kentucky Colonel, Arkansas Traveler, Barbara Jordan Media Award Winner, Actual Lives Performer, Ms. Wheelchair Texas, and a City of Amarillo “Independent Living” Award Winner.</p>
    <p class="px-3">I bleed burnt orange, meaning I am a loyal University of Texas at Austin alumni. I have a Master of Public Affairs degree and an undergraduate degree in Mass Communications from West Texas A&M. Shout out to my Texas peeps!</p>
    <p class="px-3">As you can tell, I stay pretty busy because advocacy never stops!</p>
